1. Why JDK 17 and not JDK 20
   - 17 is LTS support upto Sep-2024
   - where as JDK 20 is till Sep-2023 (till release of JDK 21)
   - Long-Term-Support (LTS)
    - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17

2. JDK 11, public support already ended, only premier and extended support available
    - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html

3. Tools
    a. Code analysis tools, e.g. sonarqube
    b. junit coverage tools, e.g. jacaco

4. Loose coupling

5. Programming to supertype

6. Use mapstruct Mappers
